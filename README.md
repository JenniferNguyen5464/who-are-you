volleyball

this hobby needed its own page because i love volleyball
ive been playing for one year and ive been hostinf my own runs 
i also add a link in the website to watch my volleyball runs 

Issues i ran into

my footer was in the middle of the page and i wanted it at the bottom but i mistakely put my div over the foot so it was nt doing anything that a human error so thats on me

the scaling of the youtube video as it was either too small or too wide. i fixed it by switching aspect-ratio: 16/9

since my page isnt long on the web i added a scroll to the top botton for mobile
